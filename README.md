GitHelpers
---

This is a project for the <a href="https://developercircles.devpost.com/">Developer Circles</a> challenge offered by Facebook.

GitHelpers is a platform for connecting with developers around the world building open source software.

### Description

Contributing to open source projects can be intimidating. GitHelpers is designed to be a forum *exclusively* for projects that need/want open source contributions.

### How it Works

The process of adding a new project on GitHelpers is a 3 step process.

1. Create a new github repository
2. Create issues that you would like with on that repository. Tag with the tag githelpers
3. Upload your project to the GitHelpers website. It will now be searchable by developers around the world.

As developers find your project, there is no lack of understanding or expectations  of whether you are looking for help. All your tagged issues become searchable, and those developers can freely open pull requests on your github repository.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Dev Notes

<b>Available Scripts</b>

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
